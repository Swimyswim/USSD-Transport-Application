# USSD-Transport-Application
A transport service that uses USSD protocol to connect drivers and passengers.
This is built using Africa's Talking and Till SMS API.
It allows users (riders/passengers and drivers) within a specific area to have access to the service free of charge.
Customers are however required to go through some registration which differs based on the role being played be it as a driver or rider.
The idea is that, revenue is generated on a monthly basis.
Commision is charged to drivers, calculated as a percentage of their monthly trips.
The rider's charge is also predetermined by various factors, taking into consideration the economic conditions such as fuel and labour prices and as such, subject to change. 
THIS PROJECT IS NOT MADE AS COMPETITTION TO UBER AND THE LIKES AS I AM SURE IS CLEAR. 
THIS IS AN ATTEMPT AT A COST EFFECTIVE AND SIMPLER ALTERNATIVE FOR USE IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE INTERNET, EDUCATION, TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC CHALLENGERS FACED.
I am relatively new to programming and this project is a growing one. 
Kindly contact me if you have any recommendations, changes or corrections you have both for this project and in programming as a whole. I will be ever grateful
